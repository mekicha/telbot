A simple Go wrapper for the Telegram Bot API

This just implements a few of the Telegram Bot API methods.

I am writing this first as a learning task for Go, but also leveraging
it to write a simple program that sends updates about a trading platform
error to an Instagram Channel.

** Still at a young stage. Will be improving it with time **
